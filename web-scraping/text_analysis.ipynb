    "#### Adjusting `TfidfVectorizer` Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to adjust the key parameters for your specific needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`max_features`**:\n",
    "    * **Decrease** this number (e.g., from 10000 to 5000) if processing is too slow, memory usage is high, or you suspect very rare words are adding noise.\n",
    "    * **Increase** or set to `None` if you believe important but less frequent terms might be excluded. Evaluate the impact on your specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`ngram_range`**:\n",
    "    * Keep `(1, 1)` (default) for single words.\n",
    "    * Change to `(1, 2)` to include **bigrams** (word pairs) if phrases like \"climate change\" seem important. Be aware this increases the feature count significantly.\n",
    "    * Use higher ranges like `(1, 3)` or `(2, 2)` cautiously, as they dramatically increase features and may require more aggressive filtering with other parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`stop_words`**:\n",
    "    * Use `'english'` as a good starting point for general text.\n",
    "    * Create a **custom list** if you notice words very common *in your specific dataset* (e.g., \"article\", \"report\") that aren't informative. You can add these to the built-in list.\n",
    "    * Set to `None` if common words (like \"not\") are crucial for your analysis (e.g., sentiment), but expect more noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`max_df`**:\n",
    "    * Keep it high (e.g., `0.95`, `1.0`) initially.\n",
    "    * **Decrease** the value (e.g., `0.90`, `0.85`) if the most frequent terms appearing in your results seem too generic *for your specific corpus* (like \"news\" in a news dataset) and don't help differentiate documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`min_df`**:\n",
    "    * Start low (e.g., `1` or `2`). `2` is common to remove words appearing only once.\n",
    "    * **Increase** the value (e.g., `3`, `5`, or a small proportion like `0.01`) if your vocabulary is excessively large, processing is slow, or you suspect typos/very rare words are adding noise."

We hoped and expected that maybe 15 to 20 out of the 28 deceased hostages would be released, but that didn't happen. Only four were announced, Mr Cooper said.Family handoutAmiram Cooper was kidnapped from his home alongside his wife on 7 October 2023He described the news as a very big disappointment for the families. It's clear to us that they could have and should have released more and that they're playing games. Mr Cooper's parents were both kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His mother was released later that month while his father was killed in captivity.Who are the released hostages?Israel identifies bodies of four deceased hostagesWhat happens next in Gaza ceasefire plan after hostage release?The Israel Defense Forces IDF said it had been operating in the area at the time but did not confirm how he was killed, referring the BBC this week to a previous statement saying the circumstances were under examination . Hamas has claimed he was killed by an Israeli military strike.AFP via Getty ImagesDozens of people were at Re'im military base to see the return of the hostages on MondayThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of many of the hostages, has called for a very serious response from the Israeli government and mediators, for what is described as Hamas's violation of the agreement . It said further stages of the peace plan should not progress until all the remaining bodies had been returned.Mr Cooper headed to the Re'im military base in southern Israel on Monday to see the return of the 20 living hostages.In recorded voice messages sent throughout the day, he described feeling tremendous anticipation and a big relief as he saw them return. But he added that the thought of the bodies coming back to Israel was heartbreaking .Family handoutRuby Chen R with his son Itay L , whose body still remains in GazaSpeaking again the following day, after the news that the four bodies returned did not include Amiram's, he described the experience as a big rollercoaster .Mr Cooper said the return of his father's body would allow him to have some closure and to sleep better at night . Everything has been on hold, he said.Ruby Chen, whose son Itay's body remains in Gaza, said he had experienced a similar mix of emotions. We were overjoyed on Monday to see 20 hostages coming out and being reunited with their families, but we were very disappointed not to see more deceased hostages coming out, he said in a video message shared with the BBC by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. We request the Israeli government, the US and the mediators to continue the fight and put pressure on Hamas to adhere to and follow the agreement that was signed and bring back all the remaining 24 hostages in captivity, Mr Chen added.The Israeli military said on Tuesday that, following forensic tests, it had identified the four hostages whose bodies had been returned and had informed their families that their loved ones had been reburied.They were 26-year-old Israeli Guy Illouz, Bipin Joshi, a Nepalese citizen who was 23, Yossi Sharabi, a 53-year-old Israeli, and 22-year-old Daniel Peretz, an Israeli-South African dual national.Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees freed as Trump hails 'historic dawn' in Middle East'You're my life, my hero' Hostages reunite with families after two yearsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaHamasRelatedIsrael's 'yellow line' in Gaza gives Netanyahu room for manoeuvreNo room for pro-Israeli views in the arts, says TV writerVance arrives in Israel as US tries to strengthen Gaza ceasefire dealADVERTISEMENTPeople in Chicago are Loving Martha Stewart's Meal KitMarley Spoon Paid ContentPaid ContentUndoHere's How Adults Are Learning Piano An App That Fits Any KeyboardOver 50 and curious about piano?

Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval.In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport, after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport.The Dutch Economic Ministry said it made the highly exceptional decision to invoke the Goods Availability Act over acute signals of serious governance shortcomings within Nexperia. These signals posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities, the ministry said in a statement. Losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security. The statement did not detail why it thought the firm's operations were risky. A spokesperson for the minister of economic affairs told the BBC there was no further information to share.The measures are aimed to keep European chip supplies flowing and protect Dutch intellectual property, said EU-China researcher Sacha Courtial.In a crisis, a Chinese-owned company could come under pressure from Beijing to halt supplies or prioritise sales to China, crippling European industries like carmakers and electronics manufacturers, he said.The Hague's move puts economic security over free-market investment principles , in what could pave the way for other governments to follow, said Mr Courtial from the Jacques Delors Institute.The China Semiconductor Industry Association said on Tuesday that it is seriously concerned about the Dutch government taking control of Nexperia. The group described the measures as selective and discriminatory against overseas branches of Chinese enterprises and undermine open trade.'Mitigating risk'The Goods Availability Act is designed to allow the Hague to intervene in companies under exceptional circumstances. These include threats to the country's economic security and to ensure the supply of critical goods.Under the order, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Vincent Karremans, could reverse or block Nexperia's decisions if they were potentially harmful to the company's interests, to its future as a business in the Netherlands or Europe, or to ensure supply remains available in an emergency.The Dutch government added the company's production can continue as normal. This measure is intended to mitigate that risk, the ministry said.Shanghai-listed shares in Nexperia's parent company Wingtech fell by 10 on Monday morning.A Nexperia spokesperson said the company complies with all existing laws and regulations, export controls and sanctions regimes, and had no further comment.In a statement in Mandarin, Wingtech said its operations were continuing uninterrupted and it remained in close communication with its suppliers and customers.Wingtech said in a stock filing that the company's chairman, Zhang Xuezheng, was suspended from Nexperia's boards by an Amsterdam court order earlier this month.The company was also in talks with lawyers about potential legal remedies, it added.The BBC has also contacted the Chinese embassies in the Netherlands and Brussels.International BusinessChinaEuropean UnionSemiconductorsRelatedWhat's the best way to detect and destroy drones?China's economic growth slows as trade tensions with US flare upAirport inferno could cost Bangladesh 1bn in damages - expertsADVERTISEMENTPeople in Chicago are Loving Martha Stewart's Meal KitMarley Spoon Paid ContentPaid ContentUndoHere's How Adults Are Learning Piano An App That Fits Any KeyboardOver 50 and curious about piano?

No casualties were reported.The attacks in Kharkiv and Kherson condemned, respectively, by Zelenskyy as a terrorist attack and by the UN as a violation of international law come days before a scheduled meeting between Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, on Friday when the pair is expected to discuss the potential supply of long-range, precision-strike Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv to allow it to hit back at Moscow.Trump has suggested in recent days that he was considering providing Kyiv with Tomahawks, which would be the longest-range missiles in Ukraine s arsenal and could allow it to accurately strike targets deep inside Russia, including Moscow.Washington had previously ruled out supplying Ukraine with the cruise missiles, which the Kremlin has warned could have serious consequences and would entail direct US involvement in the conflict.Hospital attackedThe overnight attacks on Kharkiv, Ukraine s second largest city, hit the city s main hospital, Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Advertisement He described the strikes as an utterly terrorist, cynical attack on a place where lives are saved .A Russian attack caused injuries, evacuations and damage at a hospital in Kharkiv, Ukraine Handout Ukrainian Emergency Service via AP He said the main targets of the overnight raids across the country had once again been energy facilities and power facilities in the Kherson and Sumy regions were hit. Every day, every night, Russia strikes power plants, power lines, and our natural gas facilities, Zelenskyy said on Telegram.notification-importantGet instant alerts and updates based on your interests. Be the first to know when big stories happen.Yes, keep me updatedFor the past three years, Russia has started to target Ukraine s power grid before each winter in a campaign to demoralise the population by leaving millions without power in freezing conditions.In response to the escalating attacks on Ukraine s energy facilities, which forced outages across the country on Monday in a bid to reduce pressure on the grid, Zelenskyy has called on Ukraine s allies to help blunt Russia s long-range attacks by providing more air defence systems.Ukraine has dispatched a senior delegation to Washington to discuss boosting its defence and energy resilience, officials said on Monday.Attack on aid convoyMeanwhile, in Kherson, the UN said its convoy of four vehicles, clearly marked with World Food Programme branding, came under attack from Russian drones and artillery while delivering aid.Two trucks were damaged in the strike although no one was injured, said the UN s humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Matthias Schmale. Such attacks are utterly unacceptable. Aid workers are protected by international humanitarian law and should never be attacked, he said.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called the strike another brutal violation of international law, proving Russia s utter disregard for civilian lives and its international obligations .The UN s sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA, told the AFP news agency that the convoy was carrying 800 individual packages containing essential items for older persons, women and girls .Aid groups have reported throughout the nearly four-year invasion that their staff and facilities have come under attack from Russian forces. 1 1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE Advertisement AboutAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesYour Privacy RightsAccessibility StatementSitemapWork for usConnectConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usStay ConnectedNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ Our NetworkOur NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss 2025 Al Jazeera Media Network You rely on Al Jazeera for truth and transparencyWe process your personal information to measure and improve our sites and service, to assist our marketing campaigns and to provide personalised content and advertising.

    "#### Discussion: How Top TF-IDF Terms Reveal Article Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 TF-IDF terms for each selected article effectively act as highly relevant keywords, providing a concise summary of the core subject matter. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Article 1 (BBC - Son of Hostage):**\n",
    "    * **Top Terms:** `hostages`, `hamas`, `israeli`, `cooper`, `israel`\n",
    "    * **Topic Understanding:** These terms immediately pinpoint the article's focus on the **Israeli-Hamas conflict** specifically concerning **hostages**. The inclusion of \"**cooper**\" (the hostage's family name) demonstrates TF-IDF's ability to identify key proper nouns central to this specific article but less frequent across the whole news dataset. The high scores for \"**hostages**\" and \"**hamas**\" clearly indicate they are frequent within this text and relatively distinctive compared to other articles in the corpus, making them strong topic identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Article 11 (BBC - Nexperia Chip Firm):**\n",
    "    * **Top Terms:** `nexperia`, `dutch`, `china`, `european`, `economic`\n",
    "    * **Topic Understanding:** The top terms perfectly summarize the article's subject: the **Dutch** government's intervention in the **Chinese**-owned chip firm **Nexperia**, framed within a **European** **economic** security context. \"**Nexperia**\" has the highest score because it's highly specific to this article. The other terms (\"**dutch**\", \"**china**\", \"**european**\", \"**economic**\") establish the key players and the geopolitical/economic scope of the story. Their high TF-IDF scores suggest they are discussed significantly in this article relative to their general frequency across all news items.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Article 21 (Al Jazeera - Russia Strikes):**\n",
    "    * **Top Terms:** `ukraine`, `jazeera`, `russia`, `missiles`, `convoy`\n",
    "    * **Topic Understanding:** The terms \"**ukraine**\" and \"**russia**\" clearly establish the main conflict context. \"**Missiles**\" points to the weaponry involved (specifically Ukraine seeking Tomahawks, mentioned in the text). \"**Convoy**\" refers to the specific incident involving the attacked UN aid convoy. The term \"**jazeera**\" likely has a high score because it appears frequently in boilerplate/navigation text within this specific Al Jazeera article (e.g., \"Al Jazeera experience\", \"Follow Al Jazeera\") but might be less common overall compared to news content terms across BBC/CNN articles in the dataset. While less indicative of the *news topic itself*, its high frequency *within this document* combined with moderate rarity *across the corpus* gives it a high TF-IDF score here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall:** TF-IDF effectively highlights terms that are both frequent within a single document and relatively unique compared to the rest of the corpus. This makes it good at identifying key entities (people like Cooper, companies like Nexperia, countries like Ukraine/Russia), specific events (convoy attack), and the dominant themes (hostages, economic security, missiles) that differentiate one article's topic from others."

    "**Okapi BM25 (Best Match 25)** is a ranking function used to estimate the relevance of documents to a search query, improving upon basic TF-IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Idea:** It uses term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) but adds refinements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Term Frequency Saturation:** BM25 acknowledges that relevance doesn't grow linearly with TF. Early occurrences of a term matter more than later ones; the impact saturates. The `$k_1$` parameter controls this saturation.\n",
    "2.  **Document Length Normalization:** TF-IDF can favor longer documents. BM25 normalizes scores based on document length relative to the average length in the collection, controlled by the `$b$` parameter. It penalizes overly long documents and boosts shorter ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula (Simplified):**\n",
    "The score for document *D* given query *Q* (terms $q_i$) sums scores for each query term in the document:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Score(D, Q) = Σ [ IDF(q_i) * ( (TF(q_i, D) * (k1 + 1)) / (TF(q_i, D) + k1 * (1 - b + b * (|D| / avgdl))) ) ]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* `IDF(q_i)`: Inverse Document Frequency of query term $q_i$.\n",
    "* `TF(q_i, D)`: Frequency of query term $q_i$ in document D.\n",
    "* `|D|`: Length of document D.\n",
    "* `avgdl`: Average document length.\n",
    "* `k1`: TF saturation parameter (e.g., 1.2-2.0).\n",
    "* `b`: Length normalization parameter (e.g., 0.75).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages over TF-IDF:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Better TF Handling:** Avoids overemphasizing high term counts ($k_1$).\n",
    "* **Length Normalization:** Reduces bias towards longer documents ($b$).\n",
    "* **Effective:** Generally yields better relevance rankings in practice."

    "Here's a brief overview of the `BM25Ranker` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization (`__init__`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Takes the **tokenized corpus** (list of lists of words) and BM25 parameters (`k1`, `b`).\n",
    "* Calculates and stores basic corpus stats: total documents (`N`), length of each document (`doc_len`), and average document length (`avgdl`).\n",
    "* Immediately calls `_calculate_idf` to pre-compute term statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. IDF Calculation (`_calculate_idf`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Counts the **document frequency** (DF): how many documents contain each unique term.\n",
    "* Calculates the **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** for each term using the BM25 formula, which gives higher weight to rarer terms across the corpus.\n",
    "* Stores these IDF values, ensuring terms not seen during this step get an IDF of 0 later.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. BM25 Score Calculation (`calculate_bm25_score`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculates the relevance score for **one document** against the **query tokens**.\n",
    "* For each query term found in the document:\n",
    "    * Gets the term's frequency (TF) *in that specific document*.\n",
    "    * Retrieves the pre-calculated IDF for the term.\n",
    "    * Applies the core BM25 formula: Combines IDF and TF, adjusting for term frequency saturation (`k1`) and document length relative to the average (`b`, `doc_length`, `avgdl`).\n",
    "* Sums the scores for all matching query terms to get the final document score.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ranking Documents (`rank_documents`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Takes a raw **query string**.\n",
    "* Tokenizes the query.\n",
    "* Calls `calculate_bm25_score` for **every document** in the corpus against the tokenized query.\n",
    "* **Sorts** the documents based on their calculated BM25 scores (highest score first).\n",
    "* Returns the sorted list of `(document_index, score)`."

The California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy. McCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised. Ad Feedback Ad Feedback The United States Capitol is seen on Capitol Hill on August 6, 2022 in Washington, DC. Anna Rose Layden Getty Images Related article Lawmakers return to Washington as debt limit crisis and other key issues loom This is where the risk to Americans comes in. It s hard to see how a rookie speaker, with a tiny majority and a conference containing plenty of extremists, can engineer either of these outcomes. Most countries don t require the legislature to raise the government s borrowing threshold. But the quirky situation in the US has made a once routine duty an opportunity for political mischief in a polarized age. Since the government spends more than it makes in revenue, it must borrow money to service its debt and pay for spending that Congress has already authorized. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default. At least, that s the way it has worked until now. McCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. He styled the measure as an initial way of forcing the president to the negotiating table. But the bill is purely tactical since it s got no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate. But in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members. Rep. Scott Perry, the chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, was frustrated about a lack of specificity in the plan and wanted steeper cuts. I don t know what s in the package completely. That s the issue, Perry told reporters. Some members seem reluctant to commit so far. Conservative Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN s Manu Raju, I m open to it but I m still a no vote. It is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, a McCarthy ally, was confident the plan would pass the House. The question is, what does the White House then do once we pass this package? We ve clearly stated there is no clean debt ceiling that will pass the House, he added. So we ll have the first opening offer here. And we ll see if the president s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have. McHenry s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit In effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. Any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter its GOP support. Still, the speaker was typically bullish when he predicted Monday he d have the votes to pass his initial bill. I think we got 218 to raise the debt ceiling, McCarthy told CNN. We ve got a lot of consensus within the conference. We ll get together and work through it. The US Capitol. Arturo Jimenez Anadolu Agency Getty Images Related article House Republicans in talks over one-year debt ceiling plan in push to challenge White House His assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams. But with the debt ceiling, it will be Americans livelihoods and the global economy, rather than McCarthy s immediate political ambitions, that are on the line. Republicans are yet to agree on their own demands So far, Republicans seem to be having trouble negotiating with themselves, let alone Biden. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who is helping to fashion the GOP s position, said that while the party hopes to pass the initial bill next week, challenges remain. I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in, Johnson told CNN s Manu Raju. The reality is that in a negotiation, you never get everything you want. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks? Left Rep.

Right Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg speaks during a press conference following the arraignment of former President Donald Trump April 4, 2023 in New York City. Getty Images Related article House GOP escalates defense of Trump with New York field hearing seeking to discredit Manhattan DA Another complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle no matter what. In a powerful Republican majority such holdouts could be ignored. In McCarthy s narrow majority secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of GOP expectations they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster. The coming showdown over the debt ceiling is potentially the defining moment in the two-year period of uneasy cohabitation between the Democratic president and Republican speaker. Neither Biden nor McCarthy can afford to lose, and the outcome will shape both their legacies. Republicans may have less leverage than they think There is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. There are some GOP lawmakers who sincerely worry about debt and deficits even when their party runs government. Plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt, which has crashed through 31 trillion. And Biden s big spending on Covid relief packages, infrastructure, climate mitigation measures and health care programs triggered a debate on whether he worsened the inflation crisis. But are Republicans choosing the right hill for this battle when jobs, market-linked pension plans and the economic well-being of millions are at risk? The absolutist nature of McCarthy s position pays little heed to a delicate balance of power. Democrats control the White House and the Senate, so in handing Republicans the House, albeit barely, voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation. Republicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a negotiating wedge. Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office. McCarthy needs to reverse the blame equation In order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff. He tried to do so on Monday by insisting that the biggest threat to the US economy wasn t a default but rising national debt. Without exaggeration American debt is a ticking time bomb that will detonate unless we take serious responsible action. Yet, how has President Biden reacted to this issue? He has done nothing. So in my view, and I think the rest of America, it s irresponsible, he said. Previous fiscal showdowns between GOP-controlled Congresses and Democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly on Republicans. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, for example, branded their foes in the House as economic arsonists and thereby gained political traction. McCarthy needs to reverse the equation, which is why he s trying to portray Biden as stubborn in refusing to negotiate concessions for raising the debt ceiling. The two men haven t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget which House Republicans are yet to produce and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America s reputation as a financial haven at stake. McCarthy is, therefore, in a bind. Congress, not the president, has the power to raise the government s borrowing limit. Yet the speaker is demanding Biden give away his store over a duty that only McCarthy and his lawmakers can fulfill. No one would benefit from a default especially not a president likely heading into a reelection race. But it s hard to see how McCarthy can emerge from this conundrum as the winner if he triggers an economic meltdown. The White House twisted that particular knife on Monday. There is one responsible solution to the debt limit addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office, spokesman Andrew Bates said. Republicans in the Senate have so far tried to avoid the mess. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall. President Biden does not get to stick his fingers in his ears and refuse to listen, talk or negotiate. And the American people know that. The White House needs to stop wasting time and start negotiating with the Speaker of the House, McConnell said, though notably didn t volunteer to get involved. McCarthy s speech on Monday only furthered the impression that a damaging political crisis over the debt ceiling is, after months of simmering, moving toward a boil. As Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I ll be blunt If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.

Monthly analysis revealed significant increases from October to May, followed by sharp drops from June to July in six of the nine regions.This seasonal pattern of sunshine intersects with a deeper, long-standing problem India's severe air pollution crisis - it's now among the world's top 10 polluted countries - which scientists trace back to the 1990s. Rapid urbanisation, industrial growth and land-use changes drove up fossil fuel use, vehicle emissions and biomass burning, sending aerosols into the atmosphere and dimming the Sun's rays. Getty ImagesMumbai's sunshine hours are gradually declining, the scientists foundIn winter, high air pollution from smog, temperature inversions and crop burning across the Indo-Gangetic plains produces light-scattering aerosols, which reduce sunshine hours.These aerosols - tiny solid or liquid particles from dust, vehicle exhaust, crop burning, and other sources - persist in the air long enough to affect sunlight, climate and health.During June-July, monsoon clouds blanket much of India, sharply reducing sunlight even though aerosol levels are lower than in winter.Scientists note that higher sunshine hours from October to May don't indicate cleaner air rather, they reflect more cloud-free days. Hazy winter sunlight may scatter or diffuse, lowering intensity without entirely blocking sunshine, which instruments still record as sunshine hours. Our study found that shrinking sunshine hours are linked to clouds that linger longer without releasing rain, blocking more sunlight. These longer-lasting clouds form indirectly due to aerosols that alter weather and climate, says Manoj Kumar Srivastava, a professor of geophysics at the Banaras Hindu University, and one of the authors of the study.Aerosols have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the ground in India by about 13 , while clouds accounted for an additional 31-44 drop in surface solar radiation between 1993 and 2022, according to Sachchida Nand Tripathi, an atmospheric scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology IIT Kanpur.These patterns raise concerns for agriculture, daily life and India's solar energy ambitions, while highlighting where solar panels could be most effective.Solar now makes up 47 of India's renewable energy capacity. The government says it's on track for 500GW of renewables by 2030, with more than 100GW of solar installed as of early 2025. But declining sunlight could cast a shadow on the country's solar ambitions.According to Prof Tripathi, air pollution compounds the problem. It reduces solar panel output by 12-41 depending on the type of photovoltaic system - the technology that converts sunlight into electricity - and costs an estimated 245-835m in lost power generation.LightRocket via Getty ImagesIndia's solar ambitions could be dimmed by declining sunlightStudies also show that cleaner air could boost India's annual solar energy production by 6-28 terawatt hours of electricity - enough to power millions of homes for a year.But the impact of pollution doesn't stop at solar energy. It also takes a heavy toll on agriculture, causing an estimated 36 50 loss in crop yields - mainly rice and wheat - in the country's most polluted regions, according to Prof Tripathi.India isn't alone in losing sunshine across the world, rising air pollution and shifting weather patterns have dimmed the skies.A study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics observed that Europe likely experienced reduced sunlight reaching the ground because of air pollution between1970 2009. In Germany, sunshine hours decreased by approximately 11 from 1951 to 1980, attributed to industrial gas emissions and associated cloud formation.Research also showed that stricter clean-air laws in the 1990s led to a rebound in sunshine hours across Europe.China also experienced a significant decline in sunshine hours from the 1960s to the 2000s, primarily due to increased aerosol emissions from rapid industrialisation. Sunshine duration varied across Chinese cities, with some areas experiencing more significant declines due to factors such as air pollution.The good news scientists say the Earth's surface has gradually been receiving more sunlight since the 1980s - a trend known as global brightening, following decades of dimming.New analysis of satellite data from 1984 to 2018 appears to confirm this, showing the effect is strongest over land and in the Northern Hemisphere, driven mainly by falling aerosols in the 1980s and 1990s and shifts in cloud patterns.The bad news heavily polluted countries like India are missing out. If the Sun keeps hiding behind smog, India risks running on fumes instead of full power.Solar powerThe SunAsiaClimateDelhiIndiaAir pollutionRelatedThree MPs oppose 3,500-acre solar farm plan'Cornwall is being sold off to hit net zero'Charities to bear brunt of new energy levy chargesADVERTISEMENTHere's How Adults Are Learning Piano An App That Fits Any KeyboardOver 50 and curious about piano?

      "Text starts: 'Indonesian MPs get extra allowance weeks after angry protests over perksSkip to contentAdvertisementWatch LiveBritish Broadcasting CorporationSubscribeSign InHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveDocumentariesHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveDocumentariesWeatherNewslettersWatch LiveAdvertisementIndonesian MPs get extra allowance weeks after angry protests over perks7 days agoShareSaveKoh EweSingapore andAstudestra AjengrastriJakartaShareSaveGetty ImagesThousands took to the streets in August to protest the wealth of lawmakers in IndonesiaWeeks after widespread protests swept Indonesia over the excessive pays of lawmakers, a new allowance raise has unleashed fresh public anger.Lawmakers will now get 702 million rupiah 42,400 31,800 in recess allowances - a near-double increase from the previous allowance of 400 million rupiah, said the country's deputy house speaker.The recess allowance is meant to support lawmakers carrying out their official duties, like visiting constituents, when parliament is not in session. The protests earlier in August were triggered primarily by a 3,000 monthly housing allowances given to lawmakers - nearly 10 times the minimum wage in Jakarta. These were later cut, in a bid to quell anger. August's protests began after thousands demonstrated against the housing allowances for MPs. But they soon spilled into a wider protest over corruption and economic inequality in South East Asia's largest economy.And now, news of the latest recess allowance hike - which kicked in on 3 October - has renewed controversy around this. Indonesian lawmakers take around five recesses a year, during which they visit their electoral districts and gather feedback from residents.The hike in recess allowances is meant to match the increased activities by lawmakers during their recesses, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad told reporters on Saturday. He told Reuters that the previous allowance did not take into account the rise in food and transport prices.Dasco also said on Monday that the House of Representatives would release a publicly accessible app where lawmakers are required to report on their expenditure of recess funds, to allow Indonesians to monitor their spending.It is not unheard of for lawmakers in other countries to receive allowances on top of their basic salaries to cover their official duties to their constituents. In Australia, the electorate allowance ranges from 25,000 to 37,000 per year depending on the size of the lawmaker's constituency. The latest incident is part of a growing anger over what many Indonesians perceive to be the impunity of the country's political elite. It's like Indonesians have been pranked, Lucius Karus from Formappi, a non-profit parliamentary watchdog, told local media outlets. We were satisfied by the abolition of the housing allowance but, in fact, another fantastic allowance has appeared. Part of this anger also stems from reports that a number of lawmakers had received an extra 54 million rupiah in recess allowance. Authorities later said this was due to human error and that the money had been clawed back. The government's behavior is not surprising, wrote another X user. What is surprising is why the Indonesian people still want to choose them.

Hundreds of people crowded around to wave flags and film on their phones. The man with unruly hair and sideburns in the centre of them, clad in a black leather jacket, hoisted a roaring chainsaw above his head.This was an election rally taking place in the San Martín area of the Argentine capital a month before the presidential election - and the metaphor was explicit.The candidate Javier Milei believed the state was far too bloated, with annual debts that were bigger than Argentina's entire annual economic output. Rather than 'trimming the fat', as some politicians delicately put it, he said he would take a chainsaw to ministries, subsidies and the ruling political class he derided as la casta - the caste.Getty ImagesJavier Milei's election rallies featured an unusual propMilei had form for stunts. In 2019, he dressed up in a libertarian superhero costume, purporting to be from Liberland - a land where no taxes are paid. In 2018, he smashed a piñata of the Central Bank on live television.According to official data, inflation in 2023 topped 211 annually - Milei took office in December of that year. Roughly 40 of the population lived in poverty. Years of high public spending, and a reliance on printing more money and borrowing to cover deficits, had left the country in a cycle of debts and inflation.Yet nearly two years on, the headline figures are vastly different Argentina recorded its first fiscal surplus in 14 years and inflation, which had hit triple figures annually, has tumbled to roughly 36 .The UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch called the measures Milei has taken a template for a future Conservative government. And in the US, President Donald Trump described Milei as my favourite president .They will meet in Washington on Tuesday.ReutersDonald Trump has described Milei as 'my favourite president' - they are due to meet at the White House later todayForeign investors regained confidence in Argentina too. Although that recently slipped, Washington's decision last week to swap 20bn 15bn in dollars for pesos, effectively propping up Argentina's currency with International Monetary Fund IMF backing, is a sign Milei's fiscal shock therapy has appeased international lenders. Trump and Milei's meeting will hail the deal.Yet for all the international praise, this is just one side of the story. On the streets there have been heated protests over Milei's reforms, with police firing tear gas, rubber bullets and a water cannon during clashes. He said in his campaign that this adjustment would be paid for by 'la casta' the wealthy, the politicians, the evil businessmen, says Mercedes D'Alessandro, a left-wing economist and senate candidate. But, she argues, the result was less money for pensioners and hospitals. The adjustment in the end was directed at the working classes, not the caste. ReutersMilei's reforms have prompted heated protestsMilei's critics argue that the price of his changes have been recession, job losses, weaker public services and declining household budgets. And now some economists say the country could be about to enter a recession.Milei has created a paradox. On paper, his chainsaw has achieved some of the macroeconomic successes he set out to do. But Milei has lost political support and that has spooked the markets, which in turn has destabilised his economic project.With midterm elections looming on 26 October, Argentina is about to deliver its verdict will Milei be punished for doing what he set out to do and could losing political support completely unravel his economic gains?Argentines feeling the costAround 700 miles from the capital in the Misiones province, tea farmer Ygor Sobol looks anxious. We're all going backwards economically, he says. I had to close the payroll. Now I am completely without employees. For three generations his family has grown yerba mate, a drink popular with Argentines, but since Milei deregulated his industry by scrapping minimum prices, he says that his crops have become worth less than the cost of producing them.Now, Mr Sobol says he can't afford to do basic tasks like cleaning and fertilising his plantation. And with the business making a loss, he's deciding what his family will have to go without too.ShutterstockFor all the international praise since Milei was sworn in pictured , this is just one side of the storyArgentina's multibillion dollar textile industry is also affected. Luciano Galfione, chairman of a non-profit for the sector Fundacion Pro Tejer, describes daily closures and job losses.Unlike Trump's approach of raising tariffs to promote America First , Milei cut tariffs and other criteria for imports. I have environmental controls, labour controls - we don't pay people 80 60 a month, or have 16-hour work days that might be allowed in places like Bangladesh or Vietnam. This creates an unequal playing field, Mr Galfione argues.He believes that boosting imports has battered domestic producers. Our sector lost more than 10,000 direct jobs. If you add indirect jobs, there are many more. The Global Story Trump is bailing out Argentina. What happened to 'America first'?Mr Galfione also blames rising costs of utilities, health and schools for reducing the disposable income of average people, and in turn making them less likely to buy clothes.And yet amid it all, Milei is adamant that his measures will improve the lives of ordinary Argentines.'Everything was a huge mess'In the run-up to the election Milei had said there was no alternative to big cuts.As well as the soaring inflation, vast government subsidies had kept energy and transport prices down. Public spending was high, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Price controls set fixed prices for certain goods. Argentina, still, owes 31bn in debt to the IMF. The demand for public spending was brutal, argues Ramiro Castiñeira, an economist at the consultancy Econométrica who supports Milei. Society seemed willing to live with so much inflation. Or didn't recognise that inflation was a product of so much public spending. EPA - EFE REX ShutterstockOpponents of Javier Milei say ordinary people have been left with less disposable incomeInflation ate away the peso currency's purchasing power. Many ordinary Argentines handed over disproportionate sums of pesos to illegal street traders to buy dollars, fearing their money would lose value overnight. Everything was a huge mess, explains Martin Rapetti, an economics professor at the University of Buenos Aires and executive director of think tank Equilibria. People felt money slipping like water through their fingers. For many economists, drastic change even if painful was essential to restore credibility. And Milei promised radical change.He went viral for ripping government ministries such as Culture and Women off a whiteboard while shouting 'afuera!' - 'out!'Among other austerity measures, he halved government ministries, cut tens of thousands of public jobs, slashed budgets including for education, health, pensions and infrastructure, and removed subsidies spiking utility and transport prices.His initial devaluing of the peso by 50 caused inflation to spike but then it fell as people spent less and demand fell.EPA ShutterstockMilei's supporters credit him with taming Argentina's previously rampant inflation'Echoes of Thatcherism'When I met him in April 2024 at his office, there were sculptures of him with a chainsaw on display and coasters showing Margaret Thatcher's face. Thatcher is loathed by many people in Argentina owing to the Falklands War, but Milei told me he admired her and that she was brilliant. Last month one British newspaper described Milei's own approach as having echoes of Thatcherism .Miguel Boggiano, an economist on Milei's economic advisory board, is full of praise for Milei getting inflation down and reducing the deficit. When you bear in mind the starting point, that's a huge accomplishment, he says.ReutersJavier Milei's reforms have drawn comparisons with those of Margaret ThatcherHe believes this will help alleviate poverty in the long-run and enable lower taxes, but also help people to plan their own spending more easily with inflation currently fluctuating less.But Alan Cibils, an independent economist and former professor, warns reduced inflation is only a success if it is sustained over time which he believes will not be the case.The outsider advantageJavier Milei is not a career politician. Before becoming president he had two years experience as a deputy in Argentina's Congress. Being so detached kind of shields him, Prof Rapetti observes, citing a lack of signs of empathy in public life . On 7 September Milei's party lost unexpectedly badly in the Buenos Aires provincial elections. His convoy was pelted with rocks on the campaign trail. The markets panicked foreign investors sold off pesos and bonds of Argentine government debt.EPA - EFE REX ShutterstockSome observers say Milei displays a lack of empathy towards those affected by cutsFinancial markets had generally supported his economic programme. But the midterm elections were upcoming and the 15bn of debt repayments are due next year.Trump's 15bn currency swap lifeline has provided some stability Argentine bonds and the peso rose in value in response to the announcement. But D'Alessandro argues that though US intervention might solve a wider problem, nothing will change in people's real lives . We're going to continue with no investment in hospitals, education, social programmes. This money from the United States is not going to improve Argentina's infrastructure. Flawed leader or model for other countries?Some of Milei's supporters - like Mr Boggiano - believe there is something else at play in the round criticism of the president In this view much of it comes down to the opposition trying to break what Milei has done, in order to get back into power. Once everyone starts to believe stability is here to stay, investment will come back, says Mr Boggiano. I think Milei will become a model for other countries. Others are unsure. There is some stability which helps things not to explode, said Mr Cibils. But I think that stability is also a mirage. This 'tough guy' president says he's tackling corruption. Rivals say he's silencing oppositionThe 'strongman' PM who inspired Trump's playbook - but now finds his power crumblingTrump promised retribution - how far will he go?Milei had also kept inflation under control by spending the country's reserves on propping-up the peso so it didn't crash. Meanwhile, Argentina owes 20bn of debt next year.One former central bank economist, who wished to speak anonymously, warns Milei's strategy of keeping inflation down could unravel if Argentina can't pay its debts. If at the end of the day we have a financial crisis that partially undoes all the effort, then it's a failure. If it ends with social unrest, any good done will be reversed, says the economist.The left-wing governor of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, has been touted as a future presidential candidate, long ahead of the elections in 2027. He has spoken in favour of the welfare state. Some investors are calculating whether this could mean a return to the days of big spending.Getty ImagesBuenos Aires governor Axel Kicillof has been touted as a future presidential candidateAs to the question of whether Milei has succeeded, the answer largely depends how you define success - and who it is for.Many workers see shuttered factories, rocketing bills, and a vanishing safety net.Meanwhile, some investors see a success story of fiscal discipline, tamed inflation, an ally in Washington and simply a normalisation .But even as leaders abroad watch Milei's experiment with fascination, politics may explain why few are unlikely to copy it.If normal people lose faith in what he is doing, markets will also lose confidence that his programme is sustainable and that could wipe out even the 'macro' successes. He has no political expertise, and I think you need it, Prof Rapetti argues.Still, he believes it is too early to judge We are in the middle of his term The story hasn't finished.

    "#### Discussion of BM25 Ranking Relevance (Query: \"climate change\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the fuller text snippets provided for the top 5 ranked articles, the relevance to the query \"climate change\" can be assessed more accurately:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Rank 1 (Score: 3.91, Al Jazeera - Alaska Storm):** **High Relevance.** The snippet explicitly includes \"Climate\" as a topic tag or category. The core subject is a \"deadly storm\" linked to the remnants of Typhoon Halong, causing record flooding and displacement in Alaska. While not explicitly stating \"climate change caused this storm,\" the link between extreme weather events (like intense typhoons impacting unusual areas) and climate change is very strong in common discourse and scientific reporting. BM25 correctly identified this article as highly relevant due to the presence of the \"Climate\" keyword and the related theme of extreme weather impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Rank 2 (Score: 3.01, CNN - McCarthy/Economy/Debt Ceiling):** **Low to Medium Relevance.** The primary topic is US politics, specifically the debt ceiling debate between McCarthy and Biden. However, the text *does* mention Biden's spending priorities, including \"**climate mitigation measures**\". Although this is a minor point within the larger article about political strategy and economics, the presence of the word \"climate\" likely contributed significantly to its BM25 score. The term \"change\" also appears frequently in political contexts (\"What changed, Mr. President?\"). BM25 picked up on these keywords but missed that the *main focus* is not climate change itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Rank 3 (Score: 2.80, BBC - India Air Pollution):** **High Thematic Relevance.** While the headline focuses on \"air pollution\", the article explicitly discusses how aerosols (from pollution) affect sunlight, clouds, **weather, and climate**. It mentions impacts on solar energy (linking to renewable energy goals often tied to climate policy) and global dimming/brightening trends. Although not solely about anthropogenic global warming, the article directly connects pollution to **climate effects**. BM25 accurately identified this strong thematic link, likely due to the co-occurrence of \"pollution\", \"climate\", \"sunlight\", \"weather\", and related terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Rank 4 (Score: 2.59, BBC - Indonesian MPs):** **Very Low Relevance.** This article focuses entirely on Indonesian politics regarding lawmaker allowances and public protests against perceived excessive pay and corruption. A scan of the provided text shows no mention of \"climate\" or related environmental topics. Its ranking is almost certainly due to the term \"change\" appearing in a political context (e.g., \"social change\", \"promises of... change\") or possibly statistical noise/document length factors considered by BM25.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Rank 5 (Score: 2.50, BBC - Argentina/Milei/Trump):** **Very Low Relevance.** This article is about Argentine economics and politics under President Milei, including comparisons to Thatcher and relations with Trump. The provided text contains no references to \"climate\" or environmental issues. Similar to Rank 4, its position is likely due to the statistical weight of common words like \"change\" (in economic or political contexts) or other BM25 calculation artifacts unrelated to the query's core meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Conclusion:** BM25 performed well in identifying the top article which directly tagged itself under \"Climate\" and discussed a related extreme weather event. It also correctly identified the high thematic relevance of the air pollution article due to its discussion of climate impacts. However, its reliance on term statistics (TF, IDF) without deeper semantic understanding meant it was somewhat misled by the frequent occurrence of the word \"change\" in unrelated political and economic contexts, leading to lower-relevance articles appearing in the top 5. This highlights a limitation of purely term-based ranking algorithms compared to more semantically aware methods."

    "#### Discussion of Semantic Similarities and Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an analysis of the semantic relationships between the target words and their most similar counterparts found using the `en_core_web_md` embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **war:**\n",
    "    * *Similar Words:* JEDI, STARWARS, Dynasty\n",
    "    * *Similarities:* These results are surprising and likely reflect the model associating \"war\" strongly with fictional contexts (Star Wars) or perhaps historical periods (\"Dynasty\") present in its training data, rather than contemporary geopolitical conflict. There's little direct semantic similarity in the intended news context.\n",
    "    * *Differences:* JEDI and STARWARS are proper nouns from fiction. Dynasty refers to a ruling family/period. None directly mean armed conflict between nations in the same way \"war\" does.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **government:**\n",
    "    * *Similar Words:* Depts, approves, State-run\n",
    "    * *Similarities:* These words are highly related to government functions and structure. \"Depts\" (departments) are organizational units within government. \"Approves\" is a common action taken by governmental bodies. \"State-run\" describes entities controlled by the government. The similarity is functional and contextual.\n",
    "    * *Differences:* None are direct synonyms. \"Depts\" is structural, \"approves\" is an action, and \"State-run\" is a descriptor.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **climate:**\n",
    "    * *Similar Words:* rainy, hosepipe, Overcast\n",
    "    * *Similarities:* These words are all related to **weather** phenomena or actions associated with weather conditions (like \"hosepipe\" bans during droughts, which are climate-related). The model links \"climate\" strongly to its meteorological aspects.\n",
    "    * *Differences:* \"Rainy\" and \"Overcast\" describe weather states. \"Hosepipe\" is an object associated with water usage, often restricted due to climate effects like drought. They don't capture the broader sense of long-term climate change often discussed in news.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **economy:**\n",
    "    * *Similar Words:* cliff, rally, CROSSROADS\n",
    "    * *Similarities:* These terms are often used metaphorically *in economic contexts*, especially in news reporting. \"Cliff\" likely relates to the \"fiscal cliff,\" \"rally\" to stock market or economic recovery rallies, and \"CROSSROADS\" to pivotal moments in economic policy or conditions. The connection is contextual and based on common collocations in economic news.\n",
    "    * *Differences:* These are metaphors or event descriptions, not synonyms for the system of production and consumption itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **election:**\n",
    "    * *Similar Words:* precincts, SUPERDELEGATES, At-Large\n",
    "    * *Similarities:* All these terms are directly related to the **process and structure of elections**. \"Precincts\" are voting districts, \"SUPERDELEGATES\" are specific types of delegates in US primary elections, and \"At-Large\" describes a method of election.\n",
    "    * *Differences:* They represent specific components or types related to elections, not the general concept of an election itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **technology:**\n",
    "    * *Similar Words:* CONNECTING, Paths, CONFIGURATION\n",
    "    * *Similarities:* These words relate to aspects often associated with technology, particularly networking and systems setup. \"CONNECTING\" relates to networks, \"Paths\" can refer to file paths or network routes, and \"CONFIGURATION\" to system settings. The similarity seems rooted in computing/IT contexts.\n",
    "    * *Differences:* They represent actions, abstract concepts, or processes within technology, not technology itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **health:**\n",
    "    * *Similar Words:* MACULAR, glaucoma, Type-2\n",
    "    * *Similarities:* These are all specific **medical conditions or terms**. \"MACULAR\" likely relates to macular degeneration, \"glaucoma\" is an eye condition, and \"Type-2\" strongly suggests Type-2 diabetes. The model clearly links \"health\" to specific diseases/conditions found in health news.\n",
    "    * *Differences:* They are specific examples or types of health issues, not the general concept of well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ukraine:**\n",
    "    * *Similar Words:* Chineese, penpals, ODESSA\n",
    "    * *Similarities:* \"ODESSA\" is a major city in Ukraine, showing a direct geographical link. \"Chineese\" might appear due to geopolitical discussions involving Ukraine and China. \"Penpals\" is unexpected and likely noise or an artifact of a specific, less common context in the training data.\n",
    "    * *Differences:* One is a city, one a nationality (misspelled), and one an unrelated concept. Only \"ODESSA\" has a strong, direct semantic link.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **president:**\n",
    "    * *Similar Words:* recalling, former, mulling\n",
    "    * *Similarities:* These words often appear in close proximity to \"president\" in news articles. Presidents are often \"former\" presidents, news reports discuss what presidents are \"recalling\" (past events/statements) or \"mulling\" (considering decisions). The similarity is highly contextual based on typical reporting language.\n",
    "    * *Differences:* They describe status (\"former\"), actions (\"recalling\", \"mulling\"), not the role itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **market:**\n",
    "    * *Similar Words:* Warehouses, export, TRADEABLE\n",
    "    * *Similarities:* These words are related to **commerce and trade**, which are key aspects of a \"market\". \"Warehouses\" store goods for the market, \"export\" is a market activity, and \"TRADEABLE\" describes goods within a market.\n",
    "    * *Differences:* They describe places (\"Warehouses\"), actions (\"export\"), or qualities (\"TRADEABLE\") associated with markets, rather than the market system itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall:** The embeddings generally capture contextual and conceptual relationships well (government terms, election terms, health terms, economic terms). However, some results show noise (ukraine -> penpals), overly specific links based likely on news metaphors (economy -> cliff), or influence from non-news contexts in the training data (war -> STARWARS). Capitalization also seems to play a role (e.g., SUPERDELEGATES, CROSSROADS), indicating the model sometimes treats capitalized words differently."

    "#### t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)\n",
    "\n",
    "**t-SNE** is a popular **dimensionality reduction** technique primarily used for **visualizing** high-dimensional datasets (like word embeddings which can have hundreds of dimensions) in a low-dimensional space (typically 2D or 3D).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Similarity Modeling:** It first models the similarity between pairs of high-dimensional points using probabilities. Points that are close together have a high probability of being \"picked\" as neighbors.\n",
    "2.  **Low-Dimensional Mapping:** It then tries to create a similar probability distribution for the points mapped into the low-dimensional space (e.g., a 2D plot).\n",
    "3.  **Minimizing Divergence:** The algorithm iteratively adjusts the positions of the points in the low-dimensional space to minimize the difference (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the two probability distributions (high-dimensional vs. low-dimensional).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics for Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Preserves Local Structure:** t-SNE excels at revealing the underlying **clusters** or groupings present in the data. Points that are close neighbors in the original high-dimensional space tend to end up close together in the low-dimensional map.\n",
    "* **Non-Linear:** It can capture complex, non-linear relationships between data points.\n",
    "* **Cluster Separation vs. Distance:** While it groups similar items, the *distances between different clusters* in the t-SNE plot don't always accurately represent the actual separation in the original high-dimensional space. Focus on *which points cluster together*, rather than the exact spacing between clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, t-SNE helps us *see* potential groupings and similarities in complex data that would otherwise be impossible to visualize directly."

    "#### Interpretation of the t-SNE Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot visualizes the relationships between selected words based on their pre-trained embeddings, reduced to two dimensions using t-SNE. Remember that t-SNE primarily preserves **local** structure, meaning words close together are likely semantically similar based on the contexts the model learned, but the distances **between** distinct clusters aren't always proportionally meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Geopolitical Entities:**\n",
    "    * Countries involved in recent conflicts like **\"ukraine\"**, **\"russia\"**, **\"israel\"**, and **\"gaza\"** appear somewhat dispersed but generally occupy the middle-to-right side of the plot. **\"russia\"** and **\"gaza\"** are positioned relatively near each other, perhaps reflecting their frequent co-occurrence in conflict-related news.\n",
    "    * Broader regions like **\"europe\"** and **\"america\"** are located more towards the left and center, distinct from the specific conflict zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Conflict & Military Terms:**\n",
    "    * There's a noticeable grouping of terms related to conflict: **\"war\"**, **\"conflict\"**, **\"attack\"**, **\"military\"**, and **\"soldiers\"**.\n",
    "    * **\"war\"** and **\"conflict\"** are relatively close, as expected.\n",
    "    * **\"military\"** and **\"soldiers\"** also appear near each other, linked semantically.\n",
    "    * **\"peace\"** is distinctly positioned away from the main conflict cluster, appropriately representing an opposing concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Politics & Governance:**\n",
    "    * Words describing political roles and systems like **\"government\"**, **\"president\"**, **\"minister\"**, **\"parliament\"**, and **\"leader\"** form a loose cluster primarily in the upper half of the plot.\n",
    "    * Interestingly, **\"election\"** is positioned far south, quite separate from the other governance terms. This might suggest its usage context (e.g., specific election events) differs significantly in the training data from general governing terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Economy & Finance:**\n",
    "    * Economic terms like **\"economy\"**, **\"market\"**, **\"trade\"**, **\"financial\"**, **\"bank\"**, and **\"oil\"** are largely grouped in the lower-left and central-lower regions.\n",
    "    * **\"trade\"** and **\"financial\"** are close on the far left, while **\"bank\"**, **\"market\"**, **\"oil\"**, and **\"economy\"** form another nearby group, indicating strong semantic links within the economic domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall:** This visualization effectively demonstrates that the word embeddings capture semantic relationships. Words belonging to distinct conceptual categories (geopolitics, conflict, governance, economy) tend to cluster together in the 2D space, confirming that the model has learned meaningful associations from its training data. The separation between clusters like \"war\"/\"conflict\" and \"economy\"/\"market\" highlights the model's ability to differentiate between major topics."
